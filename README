An easy way to keep track of your novel's progress for everyone to follow with interesting stats and graphs.

== Description ==

I created this plugin as an alternative to the spreadsheets that many people use to keep track of their novel's progress.  I'd used spreadsheets in the past, but I wanted a way to make that information public on my website so I created this.

For now, it's pretty much hard coded for NaNoWriMo, but in the future I plan on adding the option to allow it to be used for ScriptFrenzy and NaNoEdMo too.

== Installation ==

1. Upload `nanorc.php` to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
1. You should see a new tab on your Dashboard page where you can enter your word count data
1. If you want to add a quick summary of your novel to your sidebar and your theme supports widgets you should see a NaNo Report Card widget in the list of available widgets
1. To create a page with a report card use the tag `<?php nanorc_report(); ?>`, likewise to add a graph use `<?php nanorc_graph(); ?>`

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Can I use this for ScriptFrenzy, NaNoEdMo, or some other similar event? =

Absolutely!  For now all the text in the plugin makes the most sense with NaNoWriMo or other events with wordcount goals, but I'm working on creating an updated version that allows more customization for use with ScriptFrenzy, EdMo, and others.

= Where can I go to learn about the tags available? =

I've been working on getting some documentation together on my website.  The main page for the NaNoRC plugin is http://davidized.com/plugins/nanorc.
